  Locks mod for RimWorld
</p>

## Description
This addon adds new locking door system.
- Doors can be unlocked to allow enemies and prisoners to pass by (only races that have inteligence "humanlike" or above).
- Doors can now exclude vistiors (wanna lock some traders?).
- Doors can now be assigned to colonists (you can now simply restrict rooms to specific colonists without allowed area manager).
- New Flicking job: Locking/unlocking doors, it has higher priority than normal flicking job. ( "Flicking" doors is only needed when unlocking/locking. It is not required for changing rules for door).

## How to use
Select door and left click "Lock" command if you want to unlock/lock door. Right click for more options.

## Perfomance
This mod has almost zero impact on perfomance. It's quick and light.

## New mod
This is new mod. You can experience some bugs and errors.

## Compatibility
* You can enable this mod to old saves.
* You can disable this mod from saves, but you need to clear all locking/unlocking job first (all semi-transparent locks shouldn't be visible).
* There can be compatibility issues with mods that add custom doors with custom security mechanics.
